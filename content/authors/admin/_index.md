I am a determined student in the Leventhal School of Accounting at the University of Southern California looking to make a difference in the world. I am enrolled in the Master of Accounting program with specializations in Auditing, Corporate Accounting, and Public Accounting. I am always looking for opportunities to continue my pursuit of expertise within these fields, and look forward to applying my vast range of experience to the fullest wherever the opportunity presents itself. 

Beyond my educational pursuits, I run two businesses; Grewal Consulting, which provides consulting services to retail operations, and Meow Meow Heavy Industries, which specializes in the repair and resale of consumer electronics and heavy equipment.
