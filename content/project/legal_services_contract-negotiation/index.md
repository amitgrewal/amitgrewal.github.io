Grewal Consulting's second most popular service is contract negotiation assistance. We offer varying levels of assistance from simple review and advising on your terms to complete deal negotiations and procurements.

In the past decade, we have assisted in business acquisition negotiations totalling over $4.8 million, and equipment procurement negotiations totalling over $730,000.

We specialize in the acquisition of retail stores such as gas stations, convenience/liquor stores, and grocery stores but are also frequently involved in major equipment purchases including fueling systems, large-scale refrigeration, and commercial appliances. On a more limited basis, we also assist in licensing and intellectual property negotiations, mostly involving state business licenses like food, liquor, beer/wine, sales tax, etc.

Not only are our negotiation efforts thorough and exhaustive, they also have significant and proven results. Our business acquisition efforts result in an average purchase price discount of 12% and financing terms of 4%-5% even for unqualified borrowers (industry rate for qualified borrowers is 6%-8% interest).

Equipment procurement efforts generally result in discounts of 20%-35% on newer items and 40%-70% on older items (all discounts are from fair value).

Further, these discounts have been proven on a wide variety of equipment purchases and a large range of acquisition prices (ranging from $120,000 to $1.25 million).
