As Michigan's premier small-business consulting firm, Grewal Consulting offers a comprehensive technology deployment service.

We first evaluate your needs and determine the best technology products to suit your specific business. Next, we procure the desired products (using knowledge and expertise gained from Meow Meow Heavy Industries) at steep discounts. Finally, we install and deploy the products as an integrated system.

After deployment, we offer on-site training and reference guides for future use. For major issues, we also offer 24/7 maintenance and support services to keep your downtime to a minimum.
