Mill Iron Marathon, formerly known as Jet Fuel Muskegon, (related to entities: Sidhu Gas & Food LLC \[operations] and Sidhu Real Estate LLC \[land/building]) commenced operations in Mid-2016 after acquiring what was formerly known as Jet Fuel Muskegon, a large gas statioon in Muskegon, MI. The station was acquired for $1.25 million plus inventory (+i) which exactly met the seller's asking price. This deal was not negotiated further as the gas station was already heavily upgraded/invested in and had only minor issues, many other buyers had also put in offers below the asking price and been rejected as the asking price was very fair considering the station's fair value. However, I always come out on top with a seemingly impossible deal, so in this case I negotiated seller financing for my client who was unable to get bank financing. My client provided $300k as a down payment and put the rest on a land contract payable over 15 years with a 4.25% fixed rate. This interest rate alone is impressive, but the financing is made even more so when you consider that my client has zero credit history in the United States and thus no one was willing to lend him money at any interest rate. Further, he was self-employed in his home country, and thus was assumed to be even riskier.

After closing, I negotiated a fuel supply agreement with Corrigan Oil which provided 4 years of rebates up front on fuel (i.e., a cash payment) and multiple cash bonuses due to the station already having new fuel dispensers, pumps, tanks, livery, etc. The only major expense Corrigan paid was for a new price sign and register system, totalling $30k which pales in contrast to the $120k investment usually required for a station of this size. As a result, I negotiated for the remaining investment amount to be paid in cash to my client ($90K) plus even more negotiated amounts ($30K, due to large volume) and a doubling of the fuel rebate on each gallon bought.

The store was then re-painted to match the Marathon brand identity, this cost was borne by Corrigan and only amounted to $6k due to the previous upgrades at the station. The interior of the store was remodeled in 2020 for $7k and has already resulted in improved foot traffic due to the new ease of customer flow.

As with Muir Mini Mart and Belding Mini Market, the store's new register system was used to analyze trends and capitalize on them. In this case, fuel and pakcaged beverages/food were discounted even more heavily, but the loss in margin was more than made up for by the tremendous increase in volume due to the urban population density.

Current plans include the addition of more hot prepared items (due to their insanely high margins) and liquor products.

The station already offers beer and wine but did not offer liquor due to the City of Muskegon's zoning restrictions and the Michigan Liquor Control Commission's limit on licensed retailer density in urban areas. However, due to lobbying of the MLCC, I was successful in procuring a liquor license at no cost beyond the registration fees (about $500). This is an extraordinary savings, as buying a compatible liquor license would have cost over $200k and taken many years to realize a profit. The current crop of new liquor products has sold through within days of arrival, and much more is on the way to satisfy customer demand.
