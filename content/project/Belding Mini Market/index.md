Belding Mini Market, or just Mini Market or Mini Mart, (related to entities: Mini Mart LLC \[operations] and Amit Enterprises LLC \[land/building, no relation to me]) was transferred to my client in March 2017. I consider this acquisition to be my finest piece of negotiation to date as you will soon find out. The seller requested $450k plus inventory (+i) which was a very fair offer considering the store was worth around $500k-$550k +i by using sale-price to profit ratios of other similarly positioned convenience/liquor stores. The liquor license (SDD + SDM, beer/wine/liquor) alone was worth almost $150k due to intense demand for such licenses in Ionia County. However, I managed to negotiate the seller down to $325K +i after many rounds of negotiation and research of potential issues. This may seem relatively normal in relation to my other negotiated acquisitions, and even to its fiar value, but I assure you this deal was a once-in-a-lifetime event as I soon found out. Most similar retail stores require an owner-operator such as my client to work approximately 3-4 days a week and maintain moderately high ties to the store. This level of effort generally produces return-on-investment periods of around 6-7 years when the acquisition price is good. In contrast, gas stations can earn a ROI in 4-5 years with 6 days a week of work and very high ties to the station required. This liquor store earned a full ROI in 2 years and 1 month. Further, the store paid for the many upgrades and changes made to it in those 2 years, and only required 1-2 days of work per week. My client has never had to cover a shift, thus the store requires minimal if any ties. And of the 1-2 days of work, each day only requires approximately 3-4 hours of actual worktime, most of which can be done at home. Thus, this acquisition has been very benecifical for my client and is truly a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

In terms of upgrades, the store's computing and register systems were upgraded from an off-the-shelf one-size-fits-all system to a system tailored for liquor stores. This system was much more responsive due to local processing with cloud backups instead of the fully-cloud solutions that are trending among new businesses. After a 6 month trial of this system, I chose to switch to another similar system with lower card processing costs and slightly better features, saving over $3k annually in card processing fees. Further, the transition between systems was virtually effortless and seamless, with only about $500 in one-time costs and $30 in savings every month in perpetuity. This system allows me and my client to analyze sales trends and capitalize on new opportunities in much the same way as my gas station clients do with their more robust register systems. The same principle applied at Muir Mini Mart were applied here, offering deep discounts on food/beverages and then making those deals profitable through sheer volume and the resulting discounts.

The store's inside retail area and coolers were re-arranged to better position high-margin items and reduce clutter. This also increased customer flow and satisfaction while reducing dormant inventory and bad positioning. Further on, I proposed the addition of a new self-dispensing beverage station/counter for fountain pop and cappucino machines which were approved and have been a moderate success (in comparison to other successes like beverage promotions.)

The store's selection of beer, wine, and liquor was increased greatly along with a moderate reduction in snacks and candy, as children/casual customers are not the focus of this store. Repeat buyers of liquor and other products are the focus and are much more profitable. I did not neglect the other customers, as evidenced by moderate sales and profit gains in their segment, but rather I reduced the store's focus on them. The increased alcohol inventory has doubled alcohol sales in only 2 years, and is nearing 2.5x sales today. Profit on alcohol products and in general has risen 300% since the store's acquisition and continues to steadily rise. (Profit increased faster because of higher margins on liquor/higher prices)

Current plans include expanding the store's cooler size and making it walk-in to almost double beer capacity/selection (the doors will display 1-6 packs, while all other sizes will be walk-in). This will also increase the interior retail area by about 15% due to the freeing up of space taken over by stand-up coolers at the moment.
