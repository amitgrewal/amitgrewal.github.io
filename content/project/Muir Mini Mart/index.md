Muir Mini Mart (related to the legal entities: Amant Petroleum L.L.C. [operations] and Bryon Centre Properties L.L.C. [land/building, name is not a typo]) was transferred to my client on July 29, 2011 after many months of difficult negotiations. Through intensiuve research and market analysis of the surrounding Muir/Lyons Township area, I was able to assess the future growth potential of this gas station and estimate a fair purchase price of $1.1 million plus inventory (+i). The sellers were dead-set on receiving $1 million +i, but I was able to reduce the initial testing offer to $950,000 +i by explaining the many hundreds of thousands of dollars the station would require to be in top-notch operating shape again. After further examination by gas suppliers, architects, and city auditors, I was able to use the problems they identified and reduce the final acquisition cost down to $850K +i.

After closing the deal, I set out on a months-long journey to invest in upgrades for my client and make this store the region leader among its class. I bought a refurbished gas/diesel combination pump to replace a failing gas-only pump and emptied out the midgrade tank partition to make room for diesel fuel. This was a bold move at the time, since everyone used at least 3 tank partitions to house regular, midgrade, and premium fuel. However, blending premium and regular fuel could also create midgrade at the dispenser itself, thus reducing gas ordering complexity and risk of spoiled product. Further, the addition of diesel fuel was a great success, bringing in many new customers who later started coming in to the convenience-store portion of the gas station and buying high-margin food and beverage products.

The diesel fuel situation illustrates how critical market research is to a business' success and continued growth. Simply observing the high proportion of diesel vehicles (trucks and tractors) in the surrounding area, and the lack of diesel fuelling stations, gave me this immensely successful insight.

To further sustain growth, I advised my client to slash beverage prices and offer significant discounts when customers bought multiple bottles/cans. This was another smashing success, and while it was intially a profit-losing and inventory-hogging monster, the promotions ended up catapaulting the station's beverage volume which qualified it for deep discounts that made the promotions profitable, and allowing further discounts. These deep discounts drew in a large amount of customers that also bought other items and especially hot prepared foods.

Hot prepared foods have the highest margin of any gas station product, and they go well with beverages. Thus, the beverage promotions increased hot food sales which dramatically increased profits.

The addition of new top-of-the-line registers and fuel dispensers in 2016 allowed further data gathering and analysis to spot emerging trends and quickly capitalize on them, New products are promoted on the fuel dispensers, while the registers allow much more complex analysis of data and a new layer of cross-product promotions.

All of these items together combined to increase the station's profits by a staggering 100% over 2 years, 150% over 3 years, and 200% over 4 years. Now, a decade or so later, the station continues to see steady profit growth in the realm of 5% per year (up 300% from intial purchase). Overall sales fluctuate from year to year due to the large volume of low-margin gas being sold (fuel is not very profitable for gas stations, despite what it may seem), however fuel profits and overall profits have never decreased and in fact, have notched steady gains since the intial acquisition of Muir Mini Mart.
