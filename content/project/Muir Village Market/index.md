Muir Village Market (related to entities: Muir Grocery & Liquor LLC \[operations] and Muir Real Estate LLC \[land/buildings]) was acquired in late summer of 2020 at a price of $750K plus inventory (+i). The seller initially requested $900K +i, but II reduced the acquisition price by researching the store's financials and physical condition. I found that the store had decreasing sales for the past 7 years and many major upgrades were due, namely refrigeration/cooling. Using this knowledge, I negotiated the seller down to $750K +i within 2 months of my client's initial viewing of the store. Normally, deals like this take 1-1.5 years to complete from the initial viewing date.

Further, I negotiated with the seller to provide financing at very low rates on a land contract. My client for this project has very high credit ratings, and thus qualifies for low interest rates in the realm of 5% for such projects. However, this client already had a large debt load due to financing other properties and acting as a guarantor for many others. Thus, banks were unwilling to loan over $300K. The total purchase price of the store came out to be around $1.05 million when including inventory. My negotiated terms included $250k down and thus $755K financed with an 8-year maturity and 15-year amortization schedule at 4.25% fixed rate interest.

After closing, I found a large set of walk-in coolers and freezers made in 2017 by a very high-end brand. My client paid $70K for this refrigeraation equipment (box, doors, racks, condenser, evaporators, etc.), which was worth well over $210K used. These coolers and freezers were used to replace existing refriegration that was very ineffecient and required many costly repairs. Saving tons of electricity and money in the process. I also procured a can-sorting machine for my client to the tune of $3.5K, this machine normally costs about $25K-$35K. The current machines required about $2K in maintenance each year, while the new machine only required about $250 in annual maintenance.

Next, I drew up plans for re-arranging the beer and wine selection at this store. After client approval, the employees and I finished the re-arranging in 2 days. This re-arranging has led to increased customer flow rates and sales due to the simplicity and intuitiveness of the arrangement. Further, this freed up space for liquor expansion. I expanded the liquor selection by about 3 times to offer better variety and increase sales. Within 1 month, liquor sales doubled, and now have quadrupled. The updated liquor selection requires little effort as my client from Belding Mini Market offers tips and suggestions for hot products on a regular basis.

The existing register system was scrapped in favor of a newer and more robust system like that of branded gas stations. This is the same system in place at the Belding Mini Market, and thus will also be used to analyze customer data to better predict and create trends to increase sales and profit. The old system cost over $6K in annual fees and maintenance, while the one-time cost of implementing the new system is $3K and the annual recurring costs are $360 ($30 monthly licensing fee). Thus, the system has paid for itself within 6 months from the cost savings alone.
