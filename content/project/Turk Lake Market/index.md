Turk Lake Market, formerly known as New Turk Lake Market (confusing, we know), (related to entities: Turk Lake Market LLC \[operations] and Taj Real Estate LLC \[land/buildings]) was acquired in August 2019 after 3 months of negotiation.

Turk Lake Market had fallen into disrepair and bankruptcy after 3 years of neglect due to the disappearance of its principal owner, thus requiring it's minority owner (15%) to take charge. Neither owner was any good at business, and in fact had been defrauding the Michigan state and United States federal governments of tax money (both income and property) as well as suppliers. The previous owners racked up an accounts payable of over $135K with their fuel distributor! Further, the owners had opened multiple credit lines to the tune of over $275K, and an SBA loan of over $825K.

Clearly, the owners had been involved in some dhady dealings, to say the least. However, this was a great opportunity to acquire the gas station as it is situated in a prime location and was heavily discounted by the consurtium of creditors due to the effort required to bring it up to polish again.

Thus, they listed the store at $650K plus $50K for a liquor license (for Montcalm County, so not as valuable as one in Muskegon or Ionia) plus inventory (+i). After two months of negotiation, we had reduced the price to $500K plus the $50K liquor license +i. This was a very good deal considering the fair value of the gas station alone was $750K.

To protect my client and my efforts, we had the creditors put in a clause to our acquistion offer that stated they could not sell to anyone else as long as we acted in good faith. This came in very handy, as 2 more buyers submitted offers a week later, both offering around $700K plus the $50K liquor license +i.

After closing, we requested and negotiated fuel supply agreements with muliple distributors, but Corrigan Oil came out on top as they always offer more than their competitors. Corrigan Oil offered to pay for 2 new pumps (including 1 gas/diesel combo), a fuel system monitor, 2 new registers, a new price sign, and various other small items and cosmetics totalling over $125K plus another $125 loan at 3.25% interest for 5 years.

The loan was particulary impressive due to my client's lack of credit history and lack of assets (she only paid $400K out of pocket, of the total $1 million or so in acquisition and renovation costs). Further, the $125k of cash and products offered was well above the standard rate of $85K for this size of contract (5 million gallons).

After renovating the store, and branding it under Sunoco (check out the image above versus Google Street View!) we advised the client to upgrade her kitchen equipment to make hot foods faster and more consistently. We acquired the upgrades for $6K, and customers immediately notcied the difference. Hot food sales increased by $14K in the year after installing the upgrades.

Further, we tore out the broken asphalt driveway and replaced it with industrial strength concrete (strong enough for 3 semi-trucks stacked on top of each other). New customers started to flow in shortly after, as they had been wary of the dilapidated parking lot before.

Most importantly, we reduced all prices to match Muir Mini Mart and Belding Mini Market and introduced similar promotions. These have increased beverage sales by over 130% in the first year of implementation.
